<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

During his time at Hwa Chong Institution (College), Joon Hao always looked forward to receiving the photographs taken by Studio Ardent (a Service and Enrichment CCA that contributes in a great way to major school events through its photography, videography and PA/AVA services) after any key events.

However, he found it tedious to look through the hundreds of wonderful photographs by Studio Ardent in search of images with him inside to download.

That's when Joon Hao decided to create the web app 'Got My Photos?' to alleviate this problem.

'Got My Photos?' aims to help HCI (College) students automate the task of sieving out images of themselves taken by Studio Ardent.

Just in 3 simple steps, they can download Studio Ardent images that have their face in them!
